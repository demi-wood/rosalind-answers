My solutions to the bioinformatics problems found on the Rosalind using python.

My Rosalind profile: [http://rosalind.info/users/demi/]

## Structure

Each folder is named after the ID given to each probem followed by the full name of the problem.

```
id - problem_name
```

There are three files in every folder:

⋅⋅* The code solving the solution to the problem.
⋅⋅* The data provided by Rosalind.
⋅⋅* The solution created by the code.

Note that some of the earlier problems do not contain a file with the solution as the answer was very short and easier to copy and paste into the Rosalind website.
