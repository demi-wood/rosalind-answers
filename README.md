My solutions to the bioinformatics problems found on the Rosalind using python.

My Rosalind profile: http://rosalind.info/users/demi/

## Structure

Each folder is named after the ID given to each probem followed by the full name of the problem.

```
id - problem_name
```

There are three files in every folder:

* The code solving the solution to the problem.
* The data provided by Rosalind.
* The solution created by the code.

Note that some of the earlier problems do not contain a file with the solution as the answer was very short and easier to copy and paste into the Rosalind website.

Note that there may be some differences between the approaches to same aspects of different problems as I learned more efficent ways of coding in python.
